  title: Predicting Network Traffic Flow with a Multi-Layer Short-Term Memory Model
  description: In the dynamic realm of digital communication, managing and optimizing network traffic is critical. Efficient forecasting of network traffic volumes, crucial for maintaining network quality, poses significant challenges due to the volatile nature of data flow. This study introduces a novel approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks to enhance forecasting accuracy.
